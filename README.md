# Air Quality and Toxic Gas Detection System

## Overview
The rapid rise of air pollution, especially in urban and industrial areas, has raised concerns about its impact on public health and the environment. Our project aims to address this issue by implementing a real-time air quality measuring and toxic gas detection system. By monitoring the concentration of various toxic gases and providing timely alerts, our system helps users take necessary precautions to mitigate health risks associated with poor air quality.

## Major Problems
- Rapid increase in air pollution, particularly in urban and industrial zones.
- Lack of real-time air quality measuring systems.
- Health issues associated with poor air quality and exposure to toxic gases.

## Our Solution
We have developed a real-time air quality measuring and toxic gas detection system with the following features:
- Measurement of toxic gas concentrations such as CO, Ozone, NH3, Acetone, Toluene, etc.
- Alerting users through alarms when gas concentrations exceed predefined safe threshold values.
- Providing recommendations for precautionary measures such as opening windows, vents, etc.

## Applications
- Vehicle air quality monitoring and toxic gas detection for ensuring passenger safety.
- Household air quality monitoring to safeguard occupants from harmful gases.

## Future Developments
- Integration of machine learning algorithms to predict air pollution levels based on collected data.
- Implementation of proactive measures to minimize air pollution and promote environmental sustainability.

## Main Components Used
- Atmega 328
- MQ135 sensor
- MQ7 sensor
- MQ9 sensor
- MQ131 sensor
- PM 2.5 sensor
